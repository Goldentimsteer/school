# school
During the years of studying at a Midwestern State University, I have had some assignments that are just lying around in various files. 
the assignments come from various classes, most assignments are written in C++ assuming I have found them all. but some are written in assembly x86

Most assignments here don't have a description from the professor on what the program is supposed to do.
